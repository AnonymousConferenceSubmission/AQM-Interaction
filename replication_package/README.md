# Replicate or work
The information in this directory can be used for retraceing and replicating our research steps in creating the Aligned Quality-Model Map (AQM).
Starting with the snowballing literature review to retrieve SRS quality models to fill the AQM as documented in [1_Quality_Model_Snowballing](1_Quality_Model_Snowballing.xlsx). And further the formalization steps for filling the AQM. Therefore, the CQML and reqfactoronto conzeptualization approaches were applied and extended by a equivalence relationship, as described in [2_Quality_Model_Formalization](2_Quality_Model_Formalization.xlsx).

The resulting [AQM](AQM.owl) can be extended or modified using the OWL file.
